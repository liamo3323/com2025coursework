      title: SAMsoc Manga Database 
      introduction: Surrey Anime and Manga Society was established in 2006, and since then we have blossomed into a wonderful community of avid anime and manga enjoyers. Our society is open to everyone, from complete beginners to seasoned pros.

      regularsessiondescription: Every Wednesday at 6pm we meet at Lecture Theatre G to watch anime. At the start of term, we vote on which shows we would like to watch and throughout the semester we watch two short core shows and one long core. We also have a break in the middle of the session so we can grab food and play games together! Favourites from last year include Kahoot quizzes, ‘Just a Minute!’, controversial debates and drawing challenges. These games, whilst being very fun to play, also provide a good opportunity to bond with the other members, something we strongly encourage here at SAMsoc.
